# From the 5-field mutation file (chr, pos, ref, alt, sample):

# Execute all commands in a new directory that's one level below your perl and ref files, and contains your mutation file:

# 1. Split file into each separate cell line, keeping the header
awk  'NR==1 {h=$0; next} !seen[$5]++{ f="FILE_"FILENAME"_"$5".txt";print h > f } { print >> f; close(f)}' cosmic_mut.txt

# 2. Run "count_trinuc_muts_v7.pl" script on every file
for i in *.txt; do perl ../count_trinuc_muts_v7.pl pvcf ../hg38.fa $i; done

# 3. Concatenate files together, and check that the file has the same number of mutations as the initial mutation file
head -1 *BA*count.txt > all.txt; tail -n +2 -q *count.txt >> all.txt
